 	  * Encapsulation is a mechanism in java, which wraps the data(i.e. variables) and code(i.e. methods) together as a single unit
 	  	i.e. In encapsulation you can't access data (i.e. variables) as a single unit, instead we have to take the help pf methods to 
 	  		 access the data (i.e. variables)
 	  * Encapsulation is achieved by privatizing the variables and accessing them by using getters and setters methods to modify and get the 
 	    variable values
 	  * Demonstrate Encapsulation by privatizing the variables and accessing them using setters and getters methods - Demo
