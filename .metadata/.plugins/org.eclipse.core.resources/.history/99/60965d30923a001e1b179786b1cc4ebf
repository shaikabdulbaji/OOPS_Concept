 	 Polymorphism :
 	 ---------------
 	 Poly = many , morphism = forms
 	 polymorphism means one thing in many forms.
 			
 	 Types of Polymorphism :
 	 	1. Compile Time Polymorphism (Overloading) :
 	 		* Multiple methods having the same name but different signature(i.e. no.of
 	 		  parameters, type of parameters, order of parameters).
 	 		* Demonstrate Method Overloading by creating add methods having different 
 	 		  number of type of parameters or order of parameters.
 	 		* Demonstrate constructor overloading.
 	 		
 	 		 
 	 	2. RunTime Polymorphism  (Overriding):
 	 		* When a method in the child class(i.e. sub-class) is duplicate of a method in parent class(i.e. super-class), then the method in the
 	 		  sub-class is said to override the method in super-class. 
 	 		* When we create an object for sub-class and call the overidden method, the method in the sub-class will be called -Demonstrate here
 	 		* Even though the name of the method in the sub-class has the same name as a method in super-class, if the type of parameters or no.of 
 	 		  parameters differ, then the method in the sub-class will overload the method in super-class instead of overriding
 	 		* Constructors can't be overridden as the name of the constructor needs to be same as the name of the class
