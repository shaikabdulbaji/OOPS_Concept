 		* OOP in Java stands for " Object Oriented Programming "
 		* OOPS in Java stands for " Object Oriented Programming System "
 		
 		Purpose :-
 		------------
 		* OOPS Concept purpose in Java is to 
 		  " represent the 'real world entities' as 'object' in our programming code "
 		
 		Real World Entities :
 		-------------------
 		eg :- Physical things like 
 			  " Laptop, Bottle, Pen, Mobile, Mouse, MobileCharger, 
 			  Wallet, Table, Chair etc.... "
 		To represent this things as objects in Programming code is called OOPS Concept
 		
 		Different OOPS Concepts (or) Principles of OOPS in Java ?
 		1. Objects
 		2. Class
 		3. Inheritance
 		4. Polymorphism
 		5. Abstraction
 		6. Encapsulation 
 		------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 		
 		Object :
 		------
 		1. Objects are nothing but the real world entities that have " State and Behaviour ".
 		
 			eg : dog, Laptop, Bootle, Pen, Mobile, Mouse, MobileCharger, Wallet, Table, Chair etc....
 			
 			dog :
 			State -	A dog has state like " name, colour, breed "
 			Behaviour - A dog has Behaviour like " barking, eating, sleeping, walking, running "
 			
 		2. Technically speaking " Object is an Instance of a class "
 		3. Example for Object will be provided while explaining Class.
 		
 		Class :
 		-----
 		1. Class is a " Template/Blueprint " which can be used for creating Objects.
 		
 			eg :For constructing house we want a " Plan " (OR) " Template/Blueprint ", by using 
 				this plan we can construct (OR) create real world Objects.
 				
 					Plan = Template/blueprint (Class in Java)
 					Construct = Create real world entities (Object in Java)
 		----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 				
 			Class (Template/Blueprint)					Object (Real world entity)
 				DOG											Breed : Doberman
 				Breed = Variables							Name : Ginger
 				Name = Variables							Colour : Black
 				Colour = Variables
 															Breed : Pug
 				Barking										Name : Ruby
 				Eating										Colour : Brown
 				Sleeping
 				Walking										Breed : Dalmition
 				Running										Name : Piper 
 															Colour : White
