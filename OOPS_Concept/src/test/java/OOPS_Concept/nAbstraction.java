	 	Abstraction :
	 	-------------
	 	* Abstration is a methodology of hiding the lower level/implementation details from the user and only providing the functionality to them.
	 		1. The user will have information on what it does without knowing how it does work.
	 		2. i.e. Implementation is abstracted/hidden from the user.
	 	
	 	* Ways to achive abstraction in Java : 2 ways
	 		1. using Abstract classes
	 		2. using Interfaces
	 		
	 	Abstract Classes :-
	 	----------------
	 	* " By using this Abstract keyword we can partially hide the details ".
	 	* we have three things in Java 1. variables, 2. methods, 3. classes
	 	* Varaiables can't be specified with 'abstract' non-access  modifier - Demo.
	 	* on specifying a method with abstract modifier , we can just declare the method without implementing it - Demo.
	 	* Classes having at least one abstract specified method must be specified as abstract.
	 	* Sub-Class inherting the super-class needs to implement the abstract specified methods in Super-Class - Demo.
	 		 * purpose of abstract methods - used when the Super-Class don't have to implement everything, and when the sub-classes inheriting the 
	 		   super-class needs to implement them.
	 	* Object can't be created for abstract classes, we have to create a Sub-Class and access its variable/methods using Sub-Class Object 
	 	  reference - Demo.
